Manifestation & My Journey to Cracking Citi Bank
</h2>

<p class="mb-4">
There are moments in life when success feels distant, almost unreachable. Not because we lack potential, but because circumstances and outcomes make us question who we are and what we are capable of achieving. My journey to cracking Citi Bank was one such chapter. It was not a story of instant achievement or effortless victory. It was shaped by failure, doubt, self-reflection, and a determination that grew stronger each time I fell. Before success came lessons, and before lessons came challenges that pushed me into becoming someone more resilient than before.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
I failed in two major interviews, Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York. These were not small rejections that could be brushed aside. They carried weight. They stayed in the mind longer than expected. What made them hurt more was not the interviews themselves, but the reaction of people around me. The subtle jokes, the comments disguised as advice, the raised eyebrows, and the judgments that followed. “He couldn’t crack it,” they said. What they couldn’t see were the hours of dedication behind the scenes, the preparation, the sleepless nights, the commitment to improving. Failure has a strange way of exposing you to people’s opinions more than their understanding.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
But as painful as these failures were, they became my biggest teachers. I realized that rejection does not end your journey; it refocuses it. I spent time understanding my gaps, not emotionally but objectively. I revisited my basics, strengthened concepts, practiced more questions, restructured my resume, and most importantly, rebuilt my mindset. Every failure made me sharper. Every comment made me stronger. Every doubt pushed me toward growth. The process was slow, but it was steady, and over time I began to feel like a more refined version of myself.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
During this time, I turned to manifestation-not as a shortcut or a magical belief, but as a way of aligning my mindset with my goals. Manifestation for me meant visualizing the person I wanted to become, imagining myself clearing interviews, speaking confidently, contributing to real projects, and stepping into a professional environment. It wasn’t about hoping that things would happen. It was about believing that they could happen and working toward them with complete sincerity. I committed to improving every single day, whether or not anyone noticed it. I kept reminding myself that belief without action is just a wish, but belief supported by consistent effort becomes power.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
Getting shortlisted for interviews often excites people, but not clearing them brings equal disappointment from the same people. They start forming assumptions, creating their own stories, making jokes, or concluding that you simply weren’t good enough. These moments can drain your motivation, and there were times they almost did. But one lesson changed everything for me: your belief in yourself matters more than anyone else’s opinion. People see the outcome. They rarely see the hours of effort, the silent battles, the fear of failing again, the courage to try again, and the discipline to keep moving even when results don’t show up immediately.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
Everyone sees the final selection message. But no one sees the process that leads to it. They do not see the early mornings spent practicing, the late nights spent revising, the frustration of not solving something repeatedly, the moments of doubt that silently break you, and the decision to stand up every time despite all of it. Growth is a quiet journey. Improvement does not make noise. Confidence does not demand praise. It builds silently within you until one day you realize you have become someone far stronger than the version who once failed.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
Eventually, all the belief, the consistency, the preparation, and the manifestation aligned together. I cracked Citi Bank for an internship. It did not feel like luck. It felt like a natural result of everything I had been working for internally and externally. It felt like the universe acknowledging the effort I had put in when no one else was watching. It felt like a quiet victory, not over others, but over my own doubts and limitations.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
When I received the selection, I wasn’t proud because I succeeded. I was proud because I persisted. The selection was just the ending of a chapter, but the real story was written in the pages of resilience, patience, and growth. The rejections from Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York were not signs of inability. They were signs that I needed to evolve more before I could receive the opportunity that would truly fit me. And that evolution changed everything.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
So, to anyone going through failures, setbacks, or judgment from others, I want to say this with complete honesty: you are not defined by your setbacks. You are defined by how you rise after them. Confidence is the foundation on which success is built. You must never lose confidence, no matter what people say or how circumstances unfold. Always try to become the best version of yourself. Growth is not about proving others wrong but proving to yourself that you are capable of more than you thought.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
Take every negative comment as motivation to push further. Transform every doubt into determination. Trust yourself even when no one else does. And most importantly, trust the timing of your life. If you give your best with pure intention, you will be rewarded at the right time. There is a saying that guided me throughout this journey: <strong>ईश्वर देर से देता है, लेकिन देता जरूर है।</strong> God sometimes takes time, but He never forgets to reward sincere effort.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
My journey is not just a story of cracking an internship. It is a reminder that failure is not final, doubt is not permanent, and setbacks are not the end. They are simply parts of a path that prepares you for something better. Keep believing in yourself. Keep manifesting with clarity. Keep improving with consistency. Your moment will come. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but it will arrive when you are truly ready for it. And when it does, you will realize that every step of the struggle was worth it.

🌙 When a Friendship Ends Without Goodbye: A Story of Unspoken Emotions
</h2>

<p class="mb-4">
Friendship is one of the most unpredictable relationships in life. Sometimes it grows slowly
over years, and sometimes it forms instantly, as if the universe quietly ties two people together
with invisible threads. This is the story of one such bond — pure, effortless, and meaningful —
and how it ended without a goodbye.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
For more than a year, two people shared a beautiful connection. They were not lovers, they had no
unspoken promises, and no dramatic confessions. Just a simple, honest friendship. They talked
every day — from the first good morning to the last good night. They shared their goals, fears,
little victories, and daily struggles. They supported each other through exams, health issues, and
difficult days.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
The bond grew organically. He admired her simplicity, her sincerity, her focus on studies, and
how she preferred peace over chaos. She appreciated his support, his calm nature, and the way he
always encouraged her dreams. He made thoughtful efforts — small surprises, kind words,
occasional gifts, even building little things to make her smile. Their conversations were warm,
consistent, and comforting.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
But life, as it often does, began to change quietly.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
One day, she grew distant. Not intentionally cruel — just silent, unavailable, unread. Messages
that once received instant replies now stayed unseen. Calls that once sparked joy were declined.
Stories and posts were ignored. All without a clear reason, without a conversation.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
He tried understanding, tried asking softly if anything was wrong, tried giving space. But the
silence grew louder. And then came a single message — abrupt, cold, final. She said she couldn't
talk anymore. That someone in her life did not like their friendship, and she had to end it
immediately. No call, no explanation, just a line followed by a block.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
He was shocked. Not because the friendship ended, but because the way it ended lacked the respect
the bond once held.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
He wasn’t angry. Just deeply hurt.  
He had never crossed any boundaries.  
He never proposed.  
He only valued a friendship that once felt mutual and genuine.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
His emotions reacted before his mind could understand. He called her a few times — not out of
obsession, but out of confusion, out of the suddenness of it all. He simply wanted one honest
conversation, one moment of clarity, one gentle closure. But the call was cut the moment she heard
his voice.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
That was the moment he realized something important:<br />
<strong>Some endings will never give you answers.</strong>
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
He reflected on where he might have gone wrong. Maybe he cared too much. Maybe he held on too
tightly when things fell apart too quickly. Maybe his emotional responses were misunderstood as
pressure. He wasn’t perfect, but he was genuine.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
And genuineness, even if misunderstood, is never a mistake.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
Despite the pain, he carried no hatred. He knew her life had shifted — new people, new
influences, new priorities. He respected that. All he wished was that she had ended it with the
same kindness with which it began.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
So he stepped back, quietly, with dignity.  
He focused on his career, his growth, his opportunities.  
Life rewarded him — jobs, travel, experiences, and new beginnings.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
Yet, he never forgot the friendship. Not because he was stuck in the past, but because the past
had shaped him.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
He wrote his apology — not to send, but to release the weight on his heart. He accepted that
closure does not always come from the other person. Sometimes, closure is the message you write
and never deliver.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
Today, he wishes her well — truly, sincerely.  
He hopes she achieves her dreams, whether in a forest uniform, a research lab, or a new city
across the world. He hopes she becomes everything she once spoke about with shining eyes.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
Some friendships end, but their memories remain as soft echoes — reminding us of who we were, and
how deeply we once cared.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
And that is enough.

    content: `
<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Introduction</h2>

<p class="mb-4">
During my Smart India Hackathon (SIH) project, my team and I faced a complex scheduling
challenge: how do we automatically generate conflict-free timetables for colleges
while satisfying hundreds of academic, infrastructural, and NEP-based constraints?
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
A typical timetable involves multiple departments, subjects, faculty availability,
classroom capacities, lab requirements, and optional courses. Creating this manually
can take days and still lead to clashes. This inspired me to build an AI-driven
Timetable Generator capable of producing optimized schedules in minutes.
</p>

<hr class="my-6 border-gray-700" />

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Why a Genetic Algorithm?</h2>

<p class="mb-4">
Timetabling is a mix of constraint satisfaction and optimization. Traditional
approaches break down because the search space is massive, hard constraints must
always be met, and soft constraints improve the overall quality.
</p>

<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
  <li>The search space is huge (millions of combinations)</li>
  <li>Hard constraints must always be satisfied</li>
  <li>Soft constraints improve timetable quality</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-4">
Genetic Algorithms (GAs) excel because they explore large solution spaces, evolve
solutions over generations, and avoid local optima through mutation and crossover.
</p>

<hr class="my-6 border-gray-700" />

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">System Architecture</h2>

<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-3 mb-2">Backend</h3>
<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
  <li>FastAPI for high-performance APIs</li>
  <li>DEAP for Genetic Algorithms</li>
  <li>NumPy & Pandas for constraint evaluation</li>
  <li>PostgreSQL / Supabase for data storage</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-3 mb-2">Frontend</h3>
<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
  <li>React-based interface</li>
  <li>Visual timetable preview</li>
  <li>CSV / Excel export</li>
</ul>

<hr class="my-6 border-gray-700" />

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">How the Algorithm Works</h2>

<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-3 mb-2">Chromosome Structure</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
Each chromosome represents a full timetable encoded as:
<strong>course → faculty → room → day → time slot</strong>
</p>

<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-3 mb-2">Selection</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Tournament selection picks the best-performing schedules.</p>

<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-3 mb-2">Crossover</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Swapping timetable segments creates new potential solutions.</p>

<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-3 mb-2">Mutation</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Random adjustments maintain diversity in the population.</p>

<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-3 mb-2">Fitness Calculation</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Penalties are applied for:</p>

<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
  <li>Faculty clashes</li>
  <li>Room double-booking</li>
  <li>Student group overlaps</li>
  <li>Non-consecutive lab slots</li>
  <li>Overfilled classrooms</li>
</ul>

<hr class="my-6 border-gray-700" />

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Results</h2>

<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
  <li>Timetable generation time reduced by <strong>95%</strong></li>
  <li>Zero hard-constraint violations in most runs</li>
  <li>NEP-compliant scheduling with optional courses</li>
  <li>Scales to large institutions</li>
</ul>

<hr class="my-6 border-gray-700" />

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Conclusion</h2>

<p class="mb-4">
Building this AI Timetable Generator helped me combine Genetic Algorithms, FastAPI,
optimization logic, and full-stack engineering to solve a real-world scheduling problem.
It remains one of my most impactful and technically challenging projects.

      "A secure voting system using OpenCV face recognition + web authentication.",
    image: "/blog2.jpg",
    content: `
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Introduction</h2>

<p class="mb-4">
Traditional voting systems often face issues such as identity fraud, duplicate voting, manual
verification delays, and dependency on physical documents. To solve these challenges, I built a
Face Detection E-Voting System — a secure digital voting platform that uses computer vision and
liveness detection to authenticate voters before they cast their vote.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
The primary goal was to create a system where each user can vote <strong>only once</strong>, voting is
authenticated using <strong>real-time facial recognition</strong>, and the resulting process is both
transparent and tamper-proof.
</p>

<hr class="my-6 border-gray-700" />

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Why Face Detection for Voting?</h2>

<p class="mb-4">
Using face recognition significantly increases the security and reliability of an online voting
system. Unlike passwords or ID cards, facial biometrics cannot be shared, lost, or easily forged.
This ensures:
</p>

<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
  <li>Elimination of fake or duplicate voters</li>
  <li>Real-time validation without manual checking</li>
  <li>More accessible, user-friendly voting</li>
  <li>Improved security over OTP- or document-based systems</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-4">
By integrating liveness detection (eye-blink detection, head movement, etc.), the system can also
prevent spoofing attempts such as using printed photos or videos.
</p>

<hr class="my-6 border-gray-700" />

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">System Architecture</h2>

<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-3 mb-2">Frontend</h3>
<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
  <li>Webcam-based face capture</li>
  <li>Live preview before verification</li>
  <li>Secure session handling for authenticated users</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-3 mb-2">Backend</h3>
<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
  <li>FastAPI for API endpoints</li>
  <li>Face recognition using OpenCV + pre-trained models</li>
  <li>Database for voters, votes, and session logging</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-3 mb-2">Database</h3>
<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
  <li>Voter Profiles (name, ID, face encoding)</li>
  <li>Votes (candidate selected, timestamp)</li>
  <li>Audit logs for tracking all activity</li>
</ul>

<hr class="my-6 border-gray-700" />

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">How the Face Detection Works</h2>

<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-3 mb-2">1. Face Capture</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
The webcam captures a real-time image of the voter. The system checks for proper lighting,
framing, and clarity to ensure a high-quality detection.
</p>

<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-3 mb-2">2. Face Encoding</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
The image is processed through a deep learning model (like FaceNet or dlib's face encoder), which
converts the face into a numerical vector encoding representing unique facial features.
</p>

<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-3 mb-2">3. Matching</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
The generated vector is compared with stored face encodings in the database. If the match score is
above the defined threshold, the user is authenticated.
</p>

<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-3 mb-2">4. Liveness Detection</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
To prevent spoofing using images or videos, the system checks for:
</p>

<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
  <li>Blinks</li>
  <li>Head turns</li>
  <li>Facial expression changes</li>
  <li>Depth estimation (optional)</li>
</ul>

<hr class="my-6 border-gray-700" />

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Voting Flow</h2>

<ol class="list-decimal ml-6 mb-4">
  <li>User logs in using their voter ID.</li>
  <li>System prompts real-time face verification.</li>
  <li>Face match + liveness check is performed.</li>
  <li>If approved, the voter is redirected to the voting page.</li>
  <li>User selects their candidate and submits the vote.</li>
  <li>System records the vote securely and prevents re-voting.</li>
</ol>

<hr class="my-6 border-gray-700" />

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Security Features</h2>

<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
  <li><strong>One person, one vote</strong> — after voting, the user is locked from re-voting</li>
  <li><strong>Encrypted facial data</strong> stored as encodings, not raw images</li>
  <li>Automatic detection of spoofing attempts</li>
  <li>Audit logs for transparency and traceability</li>
  <li>Secure database transactions</li>
</ul>

<hr class="my-6 border-gray-700" />

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Results</h2>

<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
  <li>Accurate voter authentication with real-time face recognition</li>
  <li>Elimination of fake or duplicate entries</li>
  <li>Smooth voting experience through a modern UI</li>
  <li>Significantly improved security over traditional systems</li>
</ul>

<hr class="my-6 border-gray-700" />

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Conclusion</h2>

<p class="mb-4">
Building this Face Detection E-Voting System allowed me to combine computer vision, backend
engineering, and security design to create a reliable and modern voting platform. With proper
scaling and encryption standards, this system has real potential in institutional, university, and
local administrative elections.
